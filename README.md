develop an innovative control algorithm for a new version of a packaging machine,
The task required checking 6 conveyors belts for both obtaining a constant gap of the items to be packaged, and the buffering of the latter, managing any discontinuities in the incoming flow.

## How?
develop Beckhoff’s algorithm in the TwinCAT environment and to debug it in a virtual environment through the commercial software ISG-Virtuos
Using Digital Twin is a very innovative solution; it allows to improve the efficiency of the developing process in order to develop and verify the machine code in the absence of a prototype and in advance of production times.

## Results
The solution found is quite a robust code: it reaches the goal of the Product Phasing( maintenance of the products’ Gap equal to the desired distance) and it supports critical cases. 
Another important goal is the keeping of the wrapper’s acceleration and the conveyors’ acceleration under a certain threshold.
